# #INTRODUCTION

This project contained so many DIV tags and repeatative css many times. I have changed <DIV> tags into semantic elements. Which is also known as tags. I removed <DIV> tags because <div> elements will not help you gain the full benefits of using Web standards or CSS. I made following changes
HEADING
=======
Changed <div> tags into <header> tags

# BODY

I use <section> tags as a parent tag instead os using <div> and then I used <article> as a child tag.

# SIDE PART

Again I used <section> tag as a parent tag, for the right hand side section I used <aside> tag which is also called semantic element.

# FOOTER

I changed div class footer to footer class footer.

# CSS

I have changed the same CSS applied on different tags, I wrote those tag at one place and applied css.
